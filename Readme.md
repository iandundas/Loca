# Loca

A lightweight reactive wrapper around CLLocationManager


## Dependancies:

Loca uses ReactiveKit under the bonnet. It's recommended not to use this library if you're already compiling with another FunctionalReactive library such as ReactiveCocoa, ReactiveSwift or Rx, simply because it doesn't make sense to have multiple Functional Reactive libraries included as dependencies.
